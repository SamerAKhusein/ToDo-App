# ToDo-App
This is a simple app for managing your daily tasks. It features three screens:

### New Tasks

This screen allows you to create a new task with a title, description, and due date. Once you create a task, it will be added to the list of pending tasks in the main screen.

### Done Tasks 

This screen displays a list of tasks that you have completed. You can mark a task as done by swiping it to the right in the main screen, or by tapping the checkbox in the task details screen.

### Archived Tasks

This screen displays a list of tasks that you have archived. You can archive a task by swiping it to the left in the main screen, or by tapping the archive button in the task details screen.

### Technologies Used

This app was built with Flutter and Sqflite. The Bloc pattern was used to manage the state of the app and separate the business logic from the UI.

### Getting Started

To run the app, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine. Clone this repository and run the following command:
